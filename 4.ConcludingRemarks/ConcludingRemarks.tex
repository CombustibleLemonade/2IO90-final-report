\section{Concluding Remarks}
We created algorithms for 3 models using a quad tree and rules proposed by Alexander Wolff in \emph{Automated Label Placement in Theory and Practice} [1]. The 2-position algorithm and the 4-position algorithm are similar and run in $O(n^2)$. In practice we have found that the running time of the these algorithms are between $O(n)$ and $O(n^2)$. The solutions that these algorithms produce are not always optimal. The 1-slider algorithm runs in $\theta(n^3)$ time, this is also what we found in practice and also does not produce optimal solutions. 

\subsection{Future work}
As none of the algorithms provide optimal solutions, some future work would be to create algorithms that do provide optimal solutions. Some other improvements could be made in all of the algorithms when many collisions occur as the algorithms currently have a high running time when this occurs.
